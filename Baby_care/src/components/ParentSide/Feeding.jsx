                  1. Start introducing other foods in addition to breast milk when your baby is 6 months old (beginning of 7th month). However, if the baby is not gaining weight, complementary feeding can be started from 5 months of age.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2. When introducing complementary foods, start with a small amount of breast milk mixed with well-cooked rice gruel and give it to the baby when he/she is hungry. Then breastfeed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  3. Start with 2-3 teaspoons per day and gradually increase the amount.
                </p>
                <p>
                  4. After 4-5 days, add a type of legume (such as dhal) and cook it with the rice. Gradually add different types of vegetables, fish, meat, eggs, and iron-rich foods such as liver and beans.
                </p>
                <p>
                  5. Introduce one new food at a time to your baby. If there are no problems after 3-4 days, add another new food.
                </p>
                <p>
                  6. Legumes such as dhal, green grams, bananas, potatoes, carrots, pumpkin, spinach, and mustard greens can be introduced at this time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  7. Give one serving of mashed/pureed fruits such as banana, papaya, ripe pear (ripe, low-fiber mango), and guava per day.
                </p>
                <p>
                  8. Give 2-3 meals a day.
                </p>
                <p>
                  9. Breastfeed your baby as often as he/she wants between meals.

                <p>
                  2. Avoid forcing food under any circumstances. Feed the child until he is very hungry. For this, avoid giving food and drink (milk, biscuits, sweet food etc.) to the child from about 2 hours before a main meal.
                </p>
                <p>

                  1. Increase the number of meals given during illness. Give at least one extra meal for two weeks after recovery.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2. If the child's growth is stunted, this extra meal should be given for at least 6 months after the child gains weight.
                </p>
                <p>
                  3. Use oil when cooking. Depending on the growth of the child, the amount of oil to be used for each child may vary.
                </p>
                <p>
                  4. If the child has diarrhoea, he needs more fluids, so give him more porridge water, fruit juice, tea and pivati. Provide food at the same time.
